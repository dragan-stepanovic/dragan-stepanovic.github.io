title: Tests need to speak domain.
---

If, say, product managers are not able to understand those tests, then I'd say they don't speak domain enough.

A bonus by-product of fixing test readability is that it helps with improving the design of the production code as well.
And that, in turn, helps with testability.

What's not to love about this reinforcing feedback loop?
No need to answer, just a rhetorical question :)
