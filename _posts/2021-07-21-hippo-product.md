title: Product reflects the organizational power structure
---

Without the ability to learn and experiment faster in order to inform your product decisions, you're mostly left with relying on the opinions of people inside the company.

And guess who's opinions get to end up in the product?

Without Continuous Delivery, the product ends up being a reflection of an organization's power structure driven by HiPPO prioritization.

We need a name for this law (analogical to Conway's Law).
