title: Organizations that end up executing themselves
---

I have a feeling that decision making in organizations in which everyone is so busy that they have no time to build relationships with other people in the company and talk about the topics that are not related to the task at hand will necessarily grind to a halt.

And I think the reason is because there's a lack of trust and understanding on a personal level that needs to be in place in order for people to connect as a team with a shared understanding and goal.

Organizations focused solely on the "execution" end up executing themselves.
