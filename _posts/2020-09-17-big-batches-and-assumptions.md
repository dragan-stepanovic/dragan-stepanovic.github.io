title: Big Batches™ and assumptions
---

Big Batches™ embed:
- more assumptions
- way more second-order assumptions as a product of first order-assumptions (A x B x C x ... x N)
- carry all of these for a longer time

Small Batches™ embed:
- less assumptions
- less second-order assumptions
- carry all of these for a shorter time

Which one of these are likely to have more waste compared to the amount of effort invested?   
Or, to rephrase it, which one of these has higher effort/value ratio?  

lose-lose-lose vs win-win-win, if you ask me.
