title: Big Batches™ and assumptions
---

Big Batches™:
- embed more assumptions
- embed way more second order assumptions caused by product of first order assumptions (A x B x C x ... x N), and
- carry all of these for a longer time

Small Batches™ embed:
- embed less assumptions
- embed less second order assumptions, and
- carry all of these for a shorter time

Which one of these are likely to have more waste compared to the amount of effort invested?
Or, to rephrase it, which one of these has higher effort/value ratio?
