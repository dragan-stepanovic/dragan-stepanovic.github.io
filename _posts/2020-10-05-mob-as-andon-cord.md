title: Mob programming = andon cord
---

#mobprogramming is actually an implementation of the "Andon Cord" principle from Lean.

The whole team experiences the pain of a flawed, slow process, or of a particular individual in the team.

The pain cannot be put under the rug, which is very easy to do in the individual, Headset-Driven Development mode.

The whole team is dragging, but because everyone individually experiences the pain we're not able to see it.

So, there's a heuristic: Increase the pain of a flawed process in order to speed up the whole team.
