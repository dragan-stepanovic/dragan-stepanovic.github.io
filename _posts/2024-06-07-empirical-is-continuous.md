title: Empirical design is continuous design
---

The more we speculate upfront about what the design should be, the less likely that we'll build the contextual awareness muscle needed to look at the existing design and ask “what is it trying to tell me that I'm not hearing?”.


As so many things with XP, _continuous_ is the name of the game.

Empirical design is (also) an exercise in continuous design.
