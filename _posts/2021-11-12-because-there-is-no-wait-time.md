the cost of code review while co-creating (pairing/mobbing) is zero.

That enables super small, continuous changes and doesn't inhibit refactoring as is the case with async (by default delayed) code reviews.

"Be professional" advice doesn't really help when the system is in fact the one which mostly drives the undesirable behavior.
