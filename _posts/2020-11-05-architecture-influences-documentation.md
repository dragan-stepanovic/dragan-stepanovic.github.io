title: Architecture influences the need for documentation
---

Have you thought about how architecture and functional decomposition of a system influence documentation and a need for it? ðŸ™‚

When I encounter entity service antipattern, I also tend to encounter lots of time spent on and a need for writing service usage documentation.

The less autonomous services/teams are, the more there's a need for documentation because teams depend more on each other in order to deliver value for end-user.

So, the amount of existing documentation and a need for it can tell a lot about the quality of service boundaries in the system.
