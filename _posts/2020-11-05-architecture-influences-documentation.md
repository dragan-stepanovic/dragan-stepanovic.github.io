title: How architecture influences the need for documentation
---

Have you thought about how architecture and functional decomposition of a system influences documentation and a need for it? ðŸ™‚

The less autonomous the services and teams are, the more there's a need for documentation because teams depend more on each other in order to deliver value for end-user.

When I see entity service microservice antipattern, I tend to encounter lots of time spent on and a need for writing the documentation between the services.

So, the amount of existing documentation and a need for it can tell you about the quality of boundaries in the system.
