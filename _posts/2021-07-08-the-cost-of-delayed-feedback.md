title: The cost of delayed feedback
---

(via associated rework) on two things running in parallel is more expensive than the questionable progress being made on those two.

The more things running in parallel with delayed feedback, the bigger the cumulative difference loss. And the longer the delay of the feedback, the exponentially costlier rework.
