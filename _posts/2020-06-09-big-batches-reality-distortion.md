title:  "Big batches tend to distort perception of reality"
---

Remember the last time you faced a big failure. How difficult was it to acknowledge it and how long did that process take?
As you know, sometimes we can go whole life without being willing or ready to face it. 

Most of the times we're also biased towards arguments that would cushion the failure. And nothing wrong with that; that's just how human nature works.
The bigger the failure, the bigger the emotional pain that comes with it and the more difficult it is for our brain to bear with it. Typical coping mechanism for brain is to desperately look for ways to make it less of a failure than it actually is. And when we're making a failure less of it, we're also distorting the perception of reality, which distorts future reasoning and behavior.
This doesn't happen all the time, but we're very much _incentivized_ to behave in this way.

So, how does this compare to a small failure? Well, if facing a big failure is quite difficult, facing a small failure is much less difficult.


And here's a plot twist. You thought that this post is a life lesson, while actually it's a life lesson AND a story about small batches ðŸ˜Š

We, as humans, work in systems (organizations) which are susceptible to the same effect.
Big batches inherently carry big risks, which often lead to big failures, which are often not recognized as such, since the emotional burden that they present us with can lead to distortion of the real results. There's another thing here at play. People in charge of a big failure will be even more incentivized to distort the results since it's not just emotional burden that they have to face, but also it's their job that's at stake.

If we intervene in the system in a way that limits the amount of failure, the emotional burden to face it is going to be proportionally limited, which in turn helps with limiting the distortion of reality, and future reasoning and behavior based on the perception of it.
Oh, and keep in mind that big failures also errode trust proportionally.


Reducing the batch size (= reducing the inventory) helps a lot with limiting the amount of failure, and this limits the amount of distortion of the results that the system is incentivized for. And this in turn brings more clarity to reality.
Perception of reality changes when you employ small versus when you employ big batches. The glasses through which you're looking with are way blured with big batches. You might as well be even looking at the wrong thing completely.

To sum it up: Distortion of the results is most often proportional to the size of the batches. So, if you see a tendency for a system to distort the results, check the size of the batches.

You never thought that these two could be related? Neither did I ðŸ™‚
