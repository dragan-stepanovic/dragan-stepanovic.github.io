title: "Sign of a premature generalization is lack of pain when trying to progress"

If you didn't feel at least a bit of pain when adding new functionality, implementing process or introducing a tool, most probably you already prematurely generalized.
Empiricism assumes some pain because it's based on learning, not speculation.  

Pain is also a timing indicator for moving the slider on the solution complexity spectrum.
