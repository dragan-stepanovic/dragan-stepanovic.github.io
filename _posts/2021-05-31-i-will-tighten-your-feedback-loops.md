title: I'll tighten your team's feedback loops so much

"I'll tighten your team's feedback loops so much that because of all the new opportunities for interaction it will be impossible to not add to interpersonal relationships and team cohesion.
You'll finally have a chance to expose yourselves, nurture vulnerability, build trust and evolve from a group of people to A TEAM." - XP
