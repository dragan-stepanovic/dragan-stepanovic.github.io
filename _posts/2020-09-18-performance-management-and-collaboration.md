title: Performance management and collaboration
---

Collaboration dilutes roles, siloed skills, heroes culture, and variance in engagement.  

Wondering how many performance management systems unintentionally inhibit collaboration because managers would then have a way harder time to figure out whom to promote.  

And this goal is very likely driving local optimizations that you wanted to evade in the first place.  

Meaning optimizing the system for braggers (which is btw a reinforcing feedback loop in orgs!), not necessarily for teams making an impact.  

The problem is in the system, not in the people.
