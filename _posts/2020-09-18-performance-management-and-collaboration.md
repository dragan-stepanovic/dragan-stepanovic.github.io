title: Performance management and collaboration
---

Collaboration dilutes roles, siloed skills, heroes culture, and variance in engagement.  

Wondering how many performance management systems unintentionally inhibit collaboration because managers would then have a way harder time to figure out whom to promote.  

And this goal is very likely driving local optimizations (affecting team and org outcomes) that you wanted to evade in the first place.  
Meaning optimizing the system for braggers culture which is a reinforcing feedback loop!

The problem is in the system, not in the people.
