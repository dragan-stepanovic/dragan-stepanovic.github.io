title: Maybe the reason you have a too big team
---

is that you have too many specializations.

If you were to co-create more, the heavily demarcated specialization boundaries would dilute making it less of a need to bring more people in.

The scaling rates of teams doing co-creation and those that aren't are very much different. The latter tend to bloat because unbalanced capacities in the team tend to cause way more bottlenecks that need to be addressed by bringing in more (heavily specialized) people.
