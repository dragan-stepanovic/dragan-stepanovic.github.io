title:  "Cut the batch size instead of increasing WIP"

When faced with pressure, teams should cut the batch size instead of pulling in more stuff and increasing WIP (as it's almost always the case).

You get both increased throughput and accelerated feedback vs decreased throughput and decelerated feedback.

Win-win vs lose-lose.
