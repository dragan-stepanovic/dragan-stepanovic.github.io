title:  "Build quality in by reducing inventory"
---

Reducing inventory accelerates the feedback, so THE way to build quality in is to reduce inventory and thus shorten the feedback loop.

The larger the inventory, the more incentive to __not__ intervene and thus bad quality builds up.

This is the reason why codebases using Pull Requests keep deteriorating and cannot build quality in as compared to when people pair.
Unintegrated knowledge and lack of quality are types of inventory in codebases.
Reducing this inventory is crucial for both speed and quality.
