title: If it takes me 1 minute to rename a method
---

and 3 hours to get a review for the change, I’m either not going to rename the method or I’m going to rename it as part of some later change.

That’s how the slow review process leads to piling up cruft in the codebase.

If it takes me 1 minute to make a small change, but 10 minutes to get feedback from tests, I’m not going to run the tests after making a small change.

That’s how slow tests lead to delayed feedback, thus more rework and harder to find errors.
