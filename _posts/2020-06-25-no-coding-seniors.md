What if senior developers were not allowed to write a single line of code alone?
Instead, all the code and ideas have to go through the hands of less experienced developers during pairing/mobbing sessions.

How would this enabling constraint affect the world and dynamics in your team(s)?

Additionally, seniors starting as always navigators (expert/novice mode) and at one point seniors switching from "only navigator" to "only driver" mode.
This would mean that previous novices have become experts in the whole process.  
And that should make you happy :)
