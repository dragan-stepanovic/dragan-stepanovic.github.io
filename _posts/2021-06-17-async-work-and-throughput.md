title: Async work is killing your company's throughput
---

The problem with any async system and way of working is that it makes it very cheap to start the work (pull it in the system).  

That increases the arrival rate, which loads up the queues and overloads the system with WIP.  

And that, in turn, increases the lead time, while departure rate (throughput) plummets.  
That's the reason why you'd want to start together and co-create.

And Slack is probably the biggest queueing disaster you have.
