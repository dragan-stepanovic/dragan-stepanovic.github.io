title: A huge assumption with Ship/Show/Ask

(same as with async code reviews) is that the author knows when and what kind of feedback they need.

What I continuously notice is that the highest leverage is in discovering unknown unknown feedback. The one which we didn't even know we should've asked for.

And working together is optimized for (also) discovering that kind of feedback and discovering it sooner.
