title: What is high transaction cost?
---

An example is: How long it takes us to get enough confidence that our change didn't break previous functionality.

If it takes me a long time to do this (high transaction cost) because, perhaps, of manual testing, that high transaction cost will incentivize actors to batch up the work (increase the batch size) that comes before testing/checking.

One way to reduce the transaction cost in this example would be to automate that step.

Same thing with the deployments or PR reviews that take a long time.


The fact that it takes a long time is communicating to the actors that this step is expensive, so they are naturally incentivized towards behavior that provides them a better unit economics.
