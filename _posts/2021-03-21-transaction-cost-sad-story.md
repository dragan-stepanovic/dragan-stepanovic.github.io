title: A short, sad story about high transaction cost causing inevitable big batches and long feedback loops
---

The longer it takes me to test/check a change ->  

the more things I'm going to change before I test ->  

the more likely it's that some change is not going to be correct ->  

the longer it's going to take me to find what change was not correct ->  

the longer it's going to take me to correct the change ->  

the less I'm going to be willing to make any change next time

The intervention point for addressing technical debt is not carving out time to refactor, but accelerating feedback loops for both testing/checking and code reviews.
