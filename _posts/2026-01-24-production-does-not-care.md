title: Production doesn't care

how fast the code has been written.

Deploying 1000 LoC at once is still proportionally - often exponentially - riskier than deploying 100 LoC, regardless who wrote it.

The cost of producing big batches may have dropped with AI, but that doesn’t change the risk inherent in shipping them.

In fact, improving the efficiency of delivering big batches will likely contribute to even bigger batches to compensate for that.

And I don't even want to speculate on the number of latent failure modes that will get activated as a result of the interaction between more, bigger batches deployed in a short time frame. Popcorn time 🍿


I was trying to find an image for the change in the dynamics that will likely happen as a result of plummeting of the cost of generating more code with AI, and "elephant travelling through a boa constrictor" nails it.

Essentially, the elephant just got bigger.
