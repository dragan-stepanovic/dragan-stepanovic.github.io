_“Tell me how you measure me, and I will tell you how I will behave”_
-- Eliyahu M. Goldratt

Measurement is like a vacuum; whatever you're measuring, people will be drawn to and optimize for it.

Now, what are you optimizing for?

High output velocity?
I'll inflate points per user story.

High test coverage?
I'll write tests without assertions.

Probe period of 6 months?
I won't be honest first half of the year.

Number of problems solved?
Problem preventers will leave, while others will allow small problems to escalate before solving them.

Individual's delivery over team's delivery?
People will prefer working in silos over collaboration and helping others, otherwise it may dilute their own delivery and affect their "performance".

Be careful what you _optimize_ for, cause you just might get it.
