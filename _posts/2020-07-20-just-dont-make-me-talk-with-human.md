      "Just don't make me talk to a human"
---

Developers will agree to change their Pull Request workflow and:
- move from long-lived to short-lived branches
- have a process of at least one person reviewing their every Pull Request
- keep being interrupted to review (precisely add "LGTM 👍" to) bunch of other's Pull Requests

"Just don't make me pair and interact with a human."
