title:  "One word to cut the batch size"

There's a difference between:
"We're not saying we're not going to do this thing"  
and  
"We're just saying we're not going to do this thing _now_".

And acknowledging this difference is such a huge enabler for batch size reduction, improving focus and accelerating flow of value through the system.
