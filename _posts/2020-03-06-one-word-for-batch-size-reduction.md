title:  "One word to cut the batch size"

There's a difference between:  
_"We're not saying we're not going to do this thing"_  
and  
_"We're just saying we're not going to do this thing __now__"._

And acknowledging this difference is such a huge enabler for batch size reduction, improving focus and accelerating flow of value through the system.
