title: Continuous Integration is
---

a practice of minimizing inventory of unintegrated code.  

The lower you keep this inventory, the more of Continuous Integration you're doing.  

But keep in mind that this inventory is a function of both:
- the time since the last integration and
- amount of code not integrated

Also, larger amount of code not integrated drives the time since the last integration up.
