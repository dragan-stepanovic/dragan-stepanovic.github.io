title: The problem is not the monolith full of cruft and technical debt

The problem is the engineering culture lacking design, refactoring, and incremental development skills that produced it as an artifact.

So, instead of investing in microservices and making things even worse, why not invest in helping the culture improve and grow?
I'm yet to find an example of a technology solution solving cultural problem.
