title: Planning too soon?
---

The higher the utilization in the system, the lower the availability and responsiveness, and the earlier you feel an urge to start with work in order to plan and coordinate it.

That's a recipe for even higher WIP and utilization with more delays and even sooner upfront planning.

Decrease utilization to increase availability and responsiveness and you'll be able to plan more just-in-time with the higher amount of information available (the later you do planning the more you know about the work).
