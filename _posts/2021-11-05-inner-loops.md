title: Different levels of feedback loops 
---
There are different levels of feedback loops embedded in one another (e.g. compiler, tests, peer feedback, production, customers, etc.).

If the inner feedback loop is delayed, all others that build on top of it are delayed, as well.
The tighter the inner feedback loops, the more chance to have tighter outer feedback loops.

Delayed inner feedback loops guarantee delayed outer feedback loops.
Tighter inner feedback loops don't guarantee tighter outer feedback loops, but are preconditions for them.
