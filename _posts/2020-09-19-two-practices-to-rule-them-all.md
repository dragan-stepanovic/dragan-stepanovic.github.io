Title: Two Lean practices to rule the flow
---

Building the quality in cannot happen without a short feedback loops.

And prerequisite for short feedback loops are high flow efficiency and low inventory.



Leading indicator of high flow efficiency is low WIP limit.

Leading indicator of low inventory is small batch size.



That's all you need.



I know. Easier said than done ðŸ˜Š

The road is definitely challenging, but out of all the things that a team and org can focus on there are only two practices that guarantee high quality with fast flow.



Limiting WIP and batch size reduction.



In order to achieve this in product development XP practices are the ones that brought most of the value for me. Pairing/Mobbing, TDD, TBD, and Continuous Refactoring.
