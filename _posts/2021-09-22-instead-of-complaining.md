title: Instead of complaining about big PRs to review

you should do reviews way faster and you'll get way smaller PRs to review.

Wait time for review is what is (mostly) making the authors batch the changes.

If you were to review code immediately as it's being typed (pair/mob), you'd get 1 LoC PRs to review.
