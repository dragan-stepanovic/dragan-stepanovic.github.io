Instead of complaining about big PRs to review

you should do reviews way faster and you'll get smaller PRs for review.

The wait time for review is what is (mostly) making the author batch the changes.

If you were to review code immediately as it's being typed (pair/mob), you'll get PRs of 1 LoC change to review.
