title:  "When batch size goes down, confidence goes up"

Interestingly, I noticed that the smaller the steps I take when refactoring, the less of a need I have to run the tests.

The confidence I have about a change goes up as the size of the change goes down.

Seems like the mere act of minimizing the size of the change is actually building the quality in, not the quick feedback I get from the tests per se ðŸ¤”
