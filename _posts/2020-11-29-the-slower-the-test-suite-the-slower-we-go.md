title: The slower the test suite, the more we'll be retracing
---

The slower the test suite, the less often we'll run it, the more we'll backtrack whenever we make a wrong turn in the code, the slower we'll go at the end.

We need a good (i.e. testable) design to enable a fast test suite, so we can go faster by being able to minimize retracing.
