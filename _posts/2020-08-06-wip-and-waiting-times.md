title: WIP â‡† waiting times

---



Long waiting times in the system incentivize increase in WIP.
And, the higher the WIP, the longer the waiting times will be.

The longer I need to wait in order to continue, the more I'm tempted to start something else.
The more new things I start, the longer it will take me to finish and the more someone else is going to wait for me in order to continue.
