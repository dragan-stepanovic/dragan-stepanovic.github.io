title: WIP â‡† waiting times

---

Long waiting times in the system incentivize increase in WIP.  
And, the higher the WIP, the longer the waiting times will be.

The longer I need to wait in order to continue, the more I'm tempted to start something else.  
The more new things I start, the longer it will take me to finish and the longer someone else is going to wait for me in order to continue.  
Which incentivizes them to pull in more stuff.  

So we got ourselves one nice little reinforcing feedback loop there.
