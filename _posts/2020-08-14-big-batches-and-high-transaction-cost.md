title: High transaction cost incentivizes for big batches
---

High transaction cost incentivizes for big batches. And lack of availability (long waiting times) drives transaction cost up. I.e. the more something is rare to find, the more valuable itâ€™s perceived as.

So, in order to enable small batches, look for places in the system where the transaction cost, either real or perceived, is high and try to intervene at those points.



Continuous Delivery reduced transaction cost of deployments using automation.

XP reduces:
- transaction cost of code review using Pair/Mob programming
- transaction cost of change using Refactoring
- transaction cost of verification using TDD
- transaction cost of code integration using Continuous Integration.

All of these mechanisms are implementations of "keep inventory low" principle from Lean.
