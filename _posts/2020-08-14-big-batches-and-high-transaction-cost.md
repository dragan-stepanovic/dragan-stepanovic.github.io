title: Lack of availab
---


High transaction cost incentivizes for big batches. And lack of availability (long waiting times) drives transaction cost up.
I.e. the more something is rare to find, the more valuable it's perceived as.

So, in order to enable small batches, look for places in the system where the transaction cost, either real or perceived, is high and try to intervene at those points.
