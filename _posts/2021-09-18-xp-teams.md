title: XP teams are very rare environments where WIP is not skyrocketing

Funnily, concept of WIP limit is invisible and unknown to most of XP teams.
They do it without even knowing or trying to do it.

Trying to actively limit WIP can be an indication of a suboptimal process and representing its accidental complexity.
It should not be an intervention point in the system, contrary to what I mostly see.
