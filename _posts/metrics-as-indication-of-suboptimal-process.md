| Metric | Why do we measure it | Practices that inherently guarantee metric results we're looking for |
|---|---|---|
| Time to:
	• open PR
	• first review
	• approve
	• merge
  |  Time to:
	• open PR
	• first review
	• approve
	• merge
 | 	• slicing (on the product side) → reducing the PR size which reduces all of these times individually
	• incremental development skills → no big bang refactoring with huge PRs that take lots of time to open, review and merge
	• pairing/mobbing → in sync code review and code inspection drives review and approve times to 0
	• Trunk Based Development → since all code is already reviewed it can be directly pushed to master/trunk
