title: When evaluating the slowness of the review process
---

you have to take into account how long did it take you to make a change (processing time) not just how long it took to get a review (wait time).

Every review process can be slow enough if you make a sufficiently small change.

Except that that's not true with co-creation (pair/mob programming) ðŸ™‚
Why? Because of the instant code review (wait time is zero), there's no change small enough that would lead to a high wait to processing time ratio, which would mean a slow review process.
