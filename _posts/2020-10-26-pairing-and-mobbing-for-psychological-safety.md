title: Pairing and mobbing for Psychological Safety
---

It's very true that in environments without psychological safety pairing/mobbing or any kind of close collaboration won't work.

But it's also true that in fairly functional environments it's less likely to foster psychological safety if the team members don't have much chance to expose themselves through close collaboration in order to build trust and accept each other.

So, pairing/mobbing actually may be a prerequisite for kickstarting and nurturing psychologically safe environments.
