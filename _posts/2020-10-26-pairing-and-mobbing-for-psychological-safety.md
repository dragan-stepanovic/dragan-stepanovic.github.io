title: Pairing and mobbing for Psychological Safety
---

It's very true that in environments without psychological safety pairing/mobbing or any kind of close collaboration won't work.

But it's also true that in fairly functional environments it's less likely to foster psychological safety if the team members don't have a chance to expose themselves through close collaboration in order to build trust and accept each other.

So, pairing/mobbing actually tend to be a prerequisite for building psychologically safe environments.
