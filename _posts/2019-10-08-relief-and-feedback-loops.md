title:  "Your sense of relief is indication of a too long feedback loop"
---

In systems with very short feedback loops there are almost no events. Everything seems to be boring.
The longer the feedback loop, the more pressure builds up with time elapsed, the greater the sense of relief and achievement this produces on emotional level when the feedback loop is closed (marking an event that has just happened in the system).
Ironically enough, watching for moments of relief and achievement says a lot about existence of events that are too big, which in turn reflects the existence of too long feedback loops.

Examples of events:
- code is finally compiling after a bunch of changes. Hint: practice incremental development skills.
- tests are finally passing after a code change. Hint: same as above
- pull request is finally approved because of waiting for someone else or a long discussion that took place. Hint: try pair and mob programming
- code conflicts have finally been resolved and code is merged into trunk. Hint: try Trunk Based Development
- code is finally deployed to production. Hint: try building quality in with XP practices and true cross-collaboration of the whole team.
- finally there are no more bugs in production. Hint: same as above
- finally releasing new version of the software to customers.
- finally getting a budget for your initiative. Hint: Continuously budgeting experiments in small increments.

Hint: Look out for "finally, we managed to..." sentences.

With #NoEvents:
You're commiting your code every minute. You're getting feedback from your peers in real time through constant synchronous cross-collaboration.
You're integrating to trunk every minute. You're deploying and able to release with every commit. Etcetera.

What are some of the events/milestones you've noticed?
