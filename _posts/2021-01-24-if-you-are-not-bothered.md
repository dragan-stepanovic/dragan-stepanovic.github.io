title: If you don't feel the pain of delayed feedback with async code reviews

chances are you're used to making big changes.

I could also bet that there's a reinforcing feedback loop hiding in there

The bigger the changes you're used to make, the less you'll be bothered by the time waiting for a review.
(wait to processing time ratio goes down as the processing time goes up)

And the longer you're used to waiting for a review, the bigger the changes you'll be inclined to make.
