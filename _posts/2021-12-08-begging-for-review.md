title: If developers in your team have to repeat their asks or even worse beg 🙏
---
for reviewing their PRs (or any other help they need), your problem is not people not prioritizing other people's work and lack of "team player spirit".

Your problem is the lack of availability in the team as a consequence of high WIP and high utilization.

Noticing frequent asks and/or begging? => Reduce WIP
