title: Co-create to build a team
---

Imagine your team doing pair/mob programming so you don't have to organize discontinuous, forced, ad-hoc team-building activities.

Not that those are not useful, but relying on those to improve team cohesion is the same as relying on hackathons to improve systemic lack of innovation or technical debt days to remove the cruft accumulating every day indicating systemic inability to build the quality in.

These should be part of the process itself not external to it.
