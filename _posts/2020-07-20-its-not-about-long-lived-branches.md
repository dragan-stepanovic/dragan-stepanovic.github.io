title: Problem is not about long-lived branches
---

It's not about long-lived branches per se that's an anti-pattern. It's about coding alone for too long without the feedback.

Feedback if I solved the right problem, in the right way and if my work didn't invalidate, syntactically and semantically, work someone else has done in the meantime.

Long-lived branches indicate long feedback loop, but I can have short-lived branches and still not get (all of) this feedback.
