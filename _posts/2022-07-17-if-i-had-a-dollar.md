“pair/mob programming cannot substitute PR code review process. We still need a fresh pair of eyes to look at the changes” I'd have a million € now.

There _are_ lots of teams out there doing pair/mob programming that don't need and don't do formal, async code reviews while producing higher-quality work and also shipping faster than teams doing it.

Just because someone didn't have a chance to work in one of those environments doesn't mean that they don't exist and that this idea doesn't work.
