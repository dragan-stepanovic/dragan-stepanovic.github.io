title: The problem with optimizing the parts of the system that are not the ones that should be optimized
---

(non-constraints) is that it makes things even worse in the part of the system that is the one that should be optimized (constraint) and consequentially the whole system.

Thinking there's no harm or system-wide consequences of any optimization in the system causes huge damage to the whole system.

It's not a zero value-added action, but a negative one.
