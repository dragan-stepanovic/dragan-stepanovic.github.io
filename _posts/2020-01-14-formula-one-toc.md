Average Formula One race is 90 minutes. There are two pit stops of ~2 seconds. __Utilization of the whole pit stop crew of 22 people is 0.07%!__  

In case of F1, this minimal utilization rate doesn't bother you, but I'm pretty sure that it would bother you if some parts of your teams were utilized as low as this pit stop crew is.  
Now imagine how much achieved race time increases in case some of the pit stop members are not available when needed because they're working on something else? How much money would Ferrari loose in that case?
It's important for pit stop members to be there when it's needed, not to be utilized as much as possible.

It takes 2 seconds for the pit stop crew to change the tires. But, in case some members are not available, time waiting for those members **_dominates_** the time it takes to change the tires. This is what happens in huge majority of organizations.

>Switch from utilization mindset to throughput and flow mindset happens when we recognize that most of the time is spent in queues waiting, not in processing.

At that point we realize that **_the_** most important thing to make sure, in order to minimize the lead time and increase the throughput, is that the given skill is there _exactly_ when it's needed, rather than the skill being utilized as much as possible.

Also, from Theory of Constraints point of view, this video superbly explains why non-constraints (pit stop crew) **_must_** have excess capacity compared to the constraint (F1 car) in order to achieve the fastest lead times and highest throughput.

Your goal is not to utilize people as much as possible. Your goal is to, as much as possible, _minimize the lead time to make an impact_. Even if it means using some people or skills only 0.07% of the time.

Move people to the work, not work to the people.
