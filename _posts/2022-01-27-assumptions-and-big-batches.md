title: A very different set of questions get asked
---

when people have a chance to get immediate answers compared to when there's a delay involved.
And the difference are the questions that enable curiosity, building relationships, and trust.

Also, when it's expensive to get answers (e.g. delays in the communication), it's much more likely to assume things and for the conversation to go down the wrong path.

Communication is also susceptible to problems with big batches, which inherently carry assumptions built on top of each other.
And big batches, in turn, are a reflection of delays in the system.

Fix that, so you don't have to deal with 2nd and 3rd-degree problems.
Shorter feedback loops for more empathy.
