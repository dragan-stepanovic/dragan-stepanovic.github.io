title: Slicing for business resiliency
---
One of the big benefits of slicing, that I don't get to hear at all, is that the way we sequence slices by value, as a byproduct also serves as a guide on where are the fracture planes or seams for gracefully degrading business capabilities when things go south in production.

The same lines of slicing can often be used to shed the less important load to protect the more important parts of the business.

That's to say: besides helping with delivering value sooner and cutting wrong paths sooner, slicing also helps with increasing system's business resiliency.
