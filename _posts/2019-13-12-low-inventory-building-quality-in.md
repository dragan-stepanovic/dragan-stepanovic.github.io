title:  "Build quality in by reducing inventory"
---


Reducing inventory accelerates feedback, so THE way to build in quality is to reduce inventory and thus shorten feedback loop.

The larger the inventory, the more incentive to __not__ intervene and thus building up lack of quality.

This is the reason why codebases using Pull Requests keep deteriorating and cannot build in quality as compared to when people pair.
Unintegrated knowledge and lack of quality are types of inventory in codebases.
Reducing this inventory is crucial for both speed and quality.
