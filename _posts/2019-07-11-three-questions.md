title:  "3 powerful questions when discussing a solution"
---

Three very powerful questions to keep in mind when discussing a solution:

1) What problem is this solution solving?  
2) Do we have this problem at all?  
3) Is this the most important problem to solve?  

Most of discussions get discarded at the 2nd question.

Focus on maximizing throughput of the value, not just on implementing a solution we might like for some reason.
