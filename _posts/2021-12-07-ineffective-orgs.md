title: If an organization compensates for ineffectiveness
---

by hiring more people, don't be surprised to see the culture of ineffective parts of the organization eat away the culture of effective parts of the org, which doesn't have a need to scale at such a rate.

Throw in the mix a perverse incentive that manager's perceived power in the org is proportional to the number of people they manage (directly and indirectly) and it becomes understandable why most orgs become ineffective in a relatively short period of time and stay ineffective for a very long time, often permanently.
