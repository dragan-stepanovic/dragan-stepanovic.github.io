title: If an organization compensates for ineffectiveness
---

by hiring more people, don't be surprised to see the culture of ineffective parts of the organization eat away culture of effective parts of the org, which have a need to scale in headcount at a way lower rate.

Throw in the mix a perverse incentive that manager's perceived power in the org is proportional to the number of people they manage (directly and indirectly) and you'll understand why most orgs become ineffective in a relatively short period of time.
