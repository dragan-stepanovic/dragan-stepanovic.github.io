title: If we don't explore the ends of the spectrum deliberately
---
we're not going to know if our thinking is in fact a balancing act in the middle of the spectrum or actually at one end of it (without us even knowing it).

I.e. an end of the spectrum may likely be way further away than we think, meaning that we are actually positioned closer to the other end of it.

Thus, there's a high risk that _we_ are in fact the ones that are dogmatic (something we might be blaming others for).

Also, I know our industry is so scared of extremes, but sometimes they, counterintuitively, give you the best results for what you're optimizing for.

And we're never going to know that if we don't allow ourselves to deliberately explore the edges of it. Oftentimes, that's where the magic happens.
