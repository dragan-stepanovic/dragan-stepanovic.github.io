title: "Pull Request workflow cannot be compared to Pair Programming"
---

Here's an interesting experiment.  
Pick an existing Pull Request for a feature that was merged. Give that feature to the PR reviewer and author and asked them to do it again but pair this time.
Count the number of words, sentences or comments they have on that work/code and compare it to the number of words/sentences/comments on the PR.
Would you expect that results you got from pairing are the same as when employing PRs?
Of course not. I expect results for pairing to be multifold higher than PRs. 
And that's where you're loosing most of your quality. With each and every PR. And I bet you're chasing that quality afterwards in production which slows you way down.  

(Mostly) it's not about people, their quality mindset or lack of it, professionalism, etc. but about the system and process that is incentivizing or inhibiting certain behaviour and as a result producing undesirable end outcomes (damaged relationship with customers, stakeholders and product development team, team stress, etc.)

If you happen to try it out, do let me know of your results :)
