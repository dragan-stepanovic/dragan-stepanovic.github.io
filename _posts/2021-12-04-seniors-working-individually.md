title: Expectation that senior developers can work individually is killing team's ability to collaborate

The more they ask for help the less they feel they are meeting that expectation.

Being able to work independently doesn't mean getting value sooner. It means that people will keep their mouths shut even when they are stuck until they eventually figure it out on their own.

Younger folks try to model the same behavior as they gain more experience, reinforcing the same behavior for new people joining the team and industry.

Reduce the perceived cost of asking for help if you want to have a healthy, collaborative environment.
