title: "Big batches incentivize for choosing a suboptimal solution"
-------------
As the batch size goes up, the emotional investement in it goes up as well, since we're investing more time with the given solution.
As we become more invested in the solution, the bias towards that solution becomes stronger and it's less likely for other equal solution to surface.
It's likely that we become defensive about it as well, just because of the emotional pain of a huge rework that we would have to do in case we have 
to rework or completely change the solution.
And this makes us more likely that we're not going to choose the best solution for the given context, but the solution in which we've 
invested the most.  

Smaller batches counter the bias caused by big emotional investment.
