title:  "Correlation between number of hand offs and the need to visualize work"
---

I tend to think that there's a correlation between the number of hand-offs and the need to visualize current work. The more hand-offs we have, the more there's a need to answer the question: "where or with whom is this thing currently sitting with?". 

In case we're working TOGETHER as a cross-functional team on this thin business capability and by default limiting WIP, there's less need to answer this question.

The more columns the board has, the more hand-offs and the more need for visualization and vice versa.

As for the need to use the to-do column as a way to keep the list of all the features that we need to work on, I'd check #nobacklog approach. The longer this list, the less agile we are (taken that we really think that we have to implement all of the things in that column).

If something is very important to implement we are going to remember it. If we don't remember it, it's most probably not (enough) important.
