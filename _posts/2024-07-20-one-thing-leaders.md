title: One thing leaders often fail to understand
---

is that the system doesn't give a damn that you're mad at it because you're getting outcomes opposite to the ones you'd like to get.

All outcomes are by design.

And you're a part of the problem whether you like it or not.

The outcomes are inherently emergent.
Getting mad at emergence is still a failure to acknowledge that we can only influence, not control.
