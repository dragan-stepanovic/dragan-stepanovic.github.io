title: Teams that co-create

have way higher chances of building an environment of trust, empathy, and psychological safety.


These traits are the result of the team's way of working as much as ways of working are the result of these traits.


And when I say co-create, I mean pairing, mobbing, frequent face-to-face conversations, starting and ending together, etc.

Not async work, queues, PRs, throwing stuff over the wall, and occasionally integrating code and ideas.
