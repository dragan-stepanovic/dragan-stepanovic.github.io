title: Before I believe you

, an engineer, that “product and business pressure made us produce this mess in the code” I first need to see how tight your feedback loops are.

Because, my experience also tells me that looking at how engineers, that complain that the cruft they piled up is caused by the pressure from product/business, work, I often conclude that if they were instead given an infinite amount of time they would end up producing the same solutions.

That's then (more of) an engineering culture problem than a pressure problem.

Investing in skills that keep codebases cheap to change and minimize the amount of rework, khm XP practices khm, will also, as a byproduct, help you with building more productive relationships with your business and product partners.
