title:  "Mob Programming is a Drum Buffer Rope implementation"
---

Interested in how to implement Drum Buffer Rope from Theory of Constraints to product development teams?
Try out mob programming. It makes sure that the whole team will be running at the pace of its currently slowest skill (constraint), which is essential for:

1) avoiding local optimizations and achieving maximal throughput
2) reducing queue time to zero and minimizing lead time

As a bonus, you're also able to speed up constraint through more collaboration, which makes the whole team faster and faster.

This is especially effective in systems with volatile constraints, which product development, as an empirical process, is.
