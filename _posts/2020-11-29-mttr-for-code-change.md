title: How to minimize MTTR for change in the code?
---

TDD + refactoring in very small steps (ideally a line of code before running tests) bring MTTR from making a wrong change in the code to seconds.  

Not hours, days, or weeks as often is the case without these practices.  
Plus breaking trust and damaging relationships with partners and customers in-between.  
And all the piled-up stress and pressure.  

We go fastest by minimizing the amount of backtracking.
