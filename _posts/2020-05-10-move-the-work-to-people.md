title: "Move the work to the people, not the people to the work"
---

In order to minimize the lead time, move the people to the work, not work to the people.
This also helps people that work on a problem to understand the actual problem that you're trying to solve and often times find a better solution for it.
It also dramatically reduces the queue time (hand-offs), which decreases the lead time and increases the throughput.
Another thing is that people start feeling as part of the same team. So, 1 team of N people, not N teams of a single person.
