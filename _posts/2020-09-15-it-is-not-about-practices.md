title: It is actually not about practices
---

It's not about:
- Continuous Integration
- Trunk Based Development
- Pair Programming
- Mob Programming
- Limiting WIP

It's about the need to collaborate more and all these practices are a natural outcome of that need.  
So much that you don't even have to think about them anymore.
