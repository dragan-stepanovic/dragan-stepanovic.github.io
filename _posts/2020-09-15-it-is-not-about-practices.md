title: It's actually not about practices
---

It's not about:
- Continuous Integration
- Trunk Based Development
- Pair Programming
- Mob Programming
- Limiting WIP

They are not the goal per se.  

It's about the need to collaborate more. And all these practices emerge as a natural outcome of that need.  
So much that you don't even have to "track" them anymore.  

Bonus point with each one of these practices is that you get to increase both the quality and number of things your team is able to do.
