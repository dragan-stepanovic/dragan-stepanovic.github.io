I"<p>In systems with very short feedback loops there are almost no events. Everything seems to be boring.
The longer the feedback loop, the more pressure builds up with time elapsed, the greater the sense of relief and achievement this produces on emotional level when the feedback loop is closed (marking an event that has just happened in the system).
Ironically enough, watching for moments of relief and achievement says a lot about existence of events that are too big, which in turn reflects the existence of too long feedback loops.</p>
