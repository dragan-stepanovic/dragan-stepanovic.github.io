also incorporate this idea:
The whole idea about XP mindset can be boiled down to: "Instead of trying to do work "faster", try to accelerate the feedback loops you have.
Most of the time is lost on the slow feedback, not on the "efficiency" of work. Queue time dominates processing time.
uncompiling code, tests not passing, not being able to merge, not being able to deploy, not being able to make an impact (achieve the business outcome)
You're optimizing the wrong thing.
Pair programming is reducing the feedback loop as for the quality of the code and design, with testers about quality of XYZ and with customer about quality of feature.
you want to reduce the time to close all of these feedback loops so you want to developers, testers, customers being closer to the work you're doing in order to achieve this.
That's what mob programming is all about.
