This F1 pit stop video essentially explains the idea. It also explains why non-constraints (F1 pit stop crew in this case) _must_ have excess capacity compared to the constraint (F1 car) in order to achieve the fastest lead times.

queue time eats processing time for breakfast. focus on queues.
dependencies take waaay more time from the lead time than processing time. focus on dependencies and form teams around problem, not trying to fit the problem in the current org structure. define problems to solve and move people from the pool towards it.
teams are currently way too static for this mindset.
too much negotiations, politics and us and them mentality this creates. teams locally optimize (to do least of work) instead of focusing on problem
