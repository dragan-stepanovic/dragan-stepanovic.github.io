title: About me 
---
I'm based in Berlin and as a principal engineer help companies evolve their engineering culture, tame their bottlenecks, and maximize their throughput of value.

Typically, in search of better ways of working, exploring ends of the spectrum, and helping teams and organizations try out counter-intuitive ideas that initially don't make a lot of sense, but surprisingly end up as completely opposite of that.

I enjoys endless discussions connecting XP, Domain-Driven Design, Theory of Constraints, Systems Thinking and Lean.
