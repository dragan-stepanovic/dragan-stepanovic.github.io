title: About me

Typically, in search of better ways of working, exploring ends of the spectrum, and helping teams and organizations try out counter-intuitive ideas that initially don't make a lot of sense, but end up as completely opposite of that.  

It's been a long time since I fell in love with XP, Domain-Driven Design, and software as a craft (founder of Software Crafting Serbia community).
I enjoy endless discussions connecting XP, Lean, The Theory of Constraints, Systems Thinking, and socio-emotio-technical topics.
